# Fleet Services ROI Calculator - Calculation Methodology

## Introduction

This document explains the methodology and formulas used in the Fleet Services ROI Calculator. It provides transparency into how savings and ROI figures are calculated, including the assumptions and industry benchmarks used.

## Core Calculation Areas

### 1. Maintenance Cost Savings

Maintenance cost savings are calculated based on the reduction in routine and unplanned maintenance expenses that can be achieved through our fleet services.

**Formula:**
```
Maintenance Savings = Current Annual Maintenance Cost × Maintenance Reduction Percentage
```

**Default Assumptions:**
- Maintenance Reduction Percentage: 15-25% (varies by service package)
- This reduction comes from preventive maintenance, early issue detection, and optimized service scheduling

**Example:**
For a fleet with $10,000 annual maintenance costs per vehicle and a 20% reduction:
```
Maintenance Savings = $10,000 × 0.20 = $2,000 per vehicle annually
```

### 2. Fuel Efficiency Improvements

Fuel savings are calculated based on improved vehicle efficiency through proper maintenance, driver training, and route optimization.

**Formula:**
```
Fuel Savings = Current Annual Fuel Cost × Fuel Efficiency Improvement Percentage
```

**Default Assumptions:**
- Fuel Efficiency Improvement: 8-15% (varies by service package and vehicle type)
- Improvements come from engine optimization, driver behavior changes, and route efficiency

**Example:**
For a fleet spending $15,000 annually on fuel per vehicle with a 10% improvement:
```
Fuel Savings = $15,000 × 0.10 = $1,500 per vehicle annually
```

### 3. Downtime Reduction Value

This calculation quantifies the financial impact of reducing vehicle downtime.

**Formula:**
```
Downtime Value = (Current Downtime Days × Downtime Reduction Percentage) × Daily Downtime Cost
```

**Default Assumptions:**
- Downtime Reduction: 20-40% (varies by service package)
- Daily Downtime Cost: Calculated based on vehicle type, operational impact, and replacement costs

**Example:**
For a vehicle with 10 downtime days per year, 30% reduction, and $500 daily downtime cost:
```
Downtime Value = (10 days × 0.30) × $500 = $1,500 per vehicle annually
```

### 4. Vehicle Lifespan Extension

This calculation estimates the financial benefit of extending vehicle service life.

**Formula:**
```
Lifespan Savings = (Replacement Cost ÷ Current Lifespan Years) × Lifespan Extension Percentage
```

**Default Assumptions:**
- Lifespan Extension: 10-20% (varies by service package and vehicle type)
- This extension comes from better maintenance, reduced wear and tear, and optimized usage

**Example:**
For a $50,000 vehicle with a 5-year current lifespan and 15% extension:
```
Lifespan Savings = ($50,000 ÷ 5) × 0.15 = $1,500 per vehicle annually
```

### 5. Labor Optimization

This calculation estimates savings from reduced labor hours for fleet management and maintenance.

**Formula:**
```
Labor Savings = Current Labor Hours × Hourly Labor Cost × Labor Reduction Percentage
```

**Default Assumptions:**
- Labor Reduction: 10-30% (varies by service package)
- Reductions come from streamlined processes, reduced paperwork, and optimized scheduling

**Example:**
For 200 annual labor hours at $50/hour with a 20% reduction:
```
Labor Savings = 200 hours × $50 × 0.20 = $2,000 annually
```

## Total ROI Calculation

### Annual Savings

Total annual savings are calculated by summing all individual savings categories:

```
Total Annual Savings = Maintenance Savings + Fuel Savings + Downtime Value + Lifespan Savings + Labor Savings
```

### Return on Investment (ROI)

ROI is calculated as the percentage return on the investment in fleet services:

```
ROI = (Total Annual Savings ÷ Annual Service Cost) × 100
```

**Example:**
For total annual savings of $8,500 per vehicle and service costs of $3,000 per vehicle:
```
ROI = ($8,500 ÷ $3,000) × 100 = 283%
```

### Payback Period

The payback period calculates how quickly the investment in fleet services will be recovered:

```
Payback Period (months) = (Service Cost ÷ (Total Annual Savings ÷ 12))
```

**Example:**
For service costs of $3,000 and annual savings of $8,500:
```
Payback Period = ($3,000 ÷ ($8,500 ÷ 12)) = 4.2 months
```

### Five-Year Savings

Five-year cumulative savings projection:

```
Five-Year Savings = (Annual Savings × 5) - (Service Cost × 5)
```

**Example:**
For annual savings of $8,500 and service costs of $3,000:
```
Five-Year Savings = ($8,500 × 5) - ($3,000 × 5) = $42,500 - $15,000 = $27,500 per vehicle
```

## Industry Benchmarks

The default assumptions used in the calculator are based on industry benchmarks and our historical client data:

| Category | Light-Duty Vehicles | Medium-Duty Trucks | Heavy-Duty Trucks |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Maintenance Reduction | 15-25% | 20-30% | 20-35% |
| Fuel Efficiency Improvement | 8-15% | 10-18% | 12-20% |
| Downtime Reduction | 20-35% | 25-40% | 30-45% |
| Lifespan Extension | 10-15% | 15-20% | 15-25% |
| Labor Optimization | 10-25% | 15-30% | 20-35% |

## Customization Options

The calculator allows users to customize all assumptions to match their specific situation:

1. Adjust reduction/improvement percentages using sliders
2. Include or exclude specific benefit categories
3. Modify baseline costs and operational parameters
4. Apply different assumptions to different vehicle types

## Data Sources

The default assumptions and calculation methodologies are based on:

1. Industry research and publications
2. Historical data from existing fleet service clients
3. Department of Transportation statistics
4. Fleet management association benchmarks
5. Academic studies on fleet operations and maintenance

## Limitations and Considerations

When interpreting results, consider the following:

1. Results are projections based on the inputs and assumptions provided
2. Actual savings may vary based on implementation quality and operational factors
3. The calculator does not account for all possible variables affecting fleet operations
4. External factors like fuel price fluctuations may impact actual results
5. Results should be considered estimates for planning purposes
